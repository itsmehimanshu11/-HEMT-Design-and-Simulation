# -HEMT-Design-and-Simulation

Overview
This repository contains the design files, TCAD simulation scripts, and performance analysis for a High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) based on the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The project aims to model and characterize the DC and RF performance of the device for high-power and high-frequency applications.

The formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the AlGaN/GaN interface, due to spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization, allows for high carrier concentration and mobility, making these devices ideal for next-generation power amplifiers and RF switches.
